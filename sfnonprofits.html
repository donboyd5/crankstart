<ul>
<li><p>Obtain, analyze, summarize, and provide data on what the city-county of San Francisco paid to nonprofit organizations in the most recent year for which suitable data are available.</p></li>
<li><p>Deliver data on individual nonprofit organizations as well as data summarized by department, and to the extent data allow, by type of activity, type of nonprofit, and other categorizations that may be useful.</p></li>

<h2 data-number="1.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deliverables"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>A 5-10 page white paper that describes San Francisco spending on nonprofits, summarizes that spending, provides a high-level summary table, and explains how the data are defined and what they mean. The high-level summary table might, for example, (1) have 12 rows, listing individually the 10 nonprofits that received the largest payments, an all-other category, and a total row, and (2) have 7 columns for the 5 departments with the largest such payments, an all-other column, and a total.</p></li>
<li><p>An easy-to-navigate html file that has additional details. It would have a hyperlinked table of contents and might have tabbed output. It could summarize or categorize contracts in different ways. It could have a section for each of the 10 largest nonprofits listing each of the contracts they have, the stated purpose of each contract, and its amount.</p></li>
<li><p>An Excel spreadsheet that has a row for each nonprofit organization and a column for each department, with cells consisting of payment amounts or possibly contract amounts (or possibly a sheet with each).</p></li>
