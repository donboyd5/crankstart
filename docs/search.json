    "text": "2 About the Data\nThe analysis is based primarily on data maintained centrally by the city controller on payments to external organizations. It also summarizes selected centrally maintained information on contracts. Payments data provide information on actual spending in a specific time period. By contrast, contracts data provide information on planned spending that may occur over multiple years; the contract amount may or may not be fully spent.\nIndividual departments maintain more-detailed data on payments and contracts than data available centrally from the controller. Departments use these data for planning and management purposes.\nThe city publishes its centrally maintained payments data through two main mechanisms. The Open Book portal allows creation of user-friendly reports filtered to restrict the data to specific time periods, departments, and other subsets; it allows downloads of potentially large amounts of data but is not designed primarily for that purpose. The Open Data portal provides for bulk downloads of large data files and other information in computer-friendly formats. While the two publishing mechanisms draw on similar data, the data elements included and time periods covered may differ between Open Book and Open Data.2\nThe city publishes data on payments to external organizations in the Vendor Payments file on Open Data and makes similar user-friendly data available through a Supplier Payments report on Open Book. This is the primary source of data used in this report. The city publishes contracts data through the Supplier Contracts file on Open Data and makes the user-friendly version available through a Supplier Contracts report on Open Book. The Open Book version of the data is far more current and is used here.\nIn addition to data that the city maintains centrally, individual agencies maintain more-detailed data. The Department of Children, Youth, & Families, which has significant contracts with nonprofit organizations, provided detailed information on the funding allocations they make to nonprofit organizations.\nA nonprofit entity as the city defines it in these data must be a 501(c)(3) organization or similar entity, and must have a primary place of business that is a fixed office in San Francisco.\nThis report focuses on grants to nonprofit organizations, rather than all payments to nonprofits."
