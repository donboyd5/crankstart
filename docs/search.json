    "text": "1 Highlights\n\nThe City of San Francisco spent approximately $933 million on grants to nonprofit organizations in its 2020-21 fiscal year, according to data from the city controller.\nThe top five departments accounted for 89 percent of grants to nonprofits. Three of these departments accounted for more than $100 million each: Human Services ($347 million), Homelessness Services ($271 million), and Children, Youth and Their Families ($110 million).\nThe top five nonprofit entities receiving grant payments accounted for 30.8 percent of grants.\nThe top three nonprofit recipients of city funds were:\n\nThe Children’s Council of San Francisco, which focuses on supporting child care and early childhood education, received $85 million, or 9.1 percent of the total – the most of any nonprofit agency.\nThe San Francisco In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Public Authority, a quasi-governmental public agency established by San Francisco ordinance that provides and promotes consumer-directed in-home support, received the next most, at $75 million (8.1 percent).\nEpiscopal Community Services of San Francisco, which provides support to homeless and very low-income people, received $48 million (5.2 percent).\n\nMore than 540 additional nonprofit organizations received city funds.\nThe city controller’s data provides very little information on the uses of these funds. However, individual city departments maintain additional information on the purposes of specific grant funds. The Department of Children, Youth and Their Families provided data on their grant funded programs. These data are included in an accompanying html file and spreadsheet to illustrate the kind of information that may be available from individual agencies.\n2 Introduction\n\nNonprofit organizations play an important role in delivering services and helping the needy in San Francisco. This report presents and analyzes information on the city’s payments to nonprofit organizations for the 2020-21 city fiscal year, ending June 30, 2021.1\nThe sections below:\n\nDescribe data on payments to nonprofits,\nList the city departments with greatest payments to nonprofits,\nList the nonprofit organizations that receive the greatest payments,\nPresent a cross-tabulation of payments to major nonprofit organizations by major city departments.\nPresent selected data provided by the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families (DCYF) from its internal systems, to illustrate the kinds of additional information that may be available from agency-by-agency requests.\n\nA companion html document provides tables on payments by all departments and nonprofit organizations, in a sortable format. That document also illustrates details from one internal agency system. An associated Excel file includes the summary tables from this report plus the detailed tables in the companion html file."

    "section": "3 About the Data",
    "text": "3 About the Data\nThe analysis is based primarily on data maintained centrally by the city controller on payments to external organizations. Payments data provide information on actual spending in a specific time period.\nThe city publishes its centrally maintained payments data through two main mechanisms. The Open Book portal allows creation of user-friendly reports filtered to restrict the data to specific time periods, departments, and other subsets; it allows downloads of potentially large amounts of data but is not designed primarily for that purpose. The Open Data portal provides for bulk downloads of large data files and other information in computer-friendly formats. While the two publishing mechanisms draw on similar data, the data elements included and time periods covered may differ between Open Book and Open Data.2\nThe city publishes data on payments to external organizations in the Vendor Payments file on Open Data and makes similar user-friendly data available through a Supplier Payments report on Open Book. This is the primary source of data used in this report.\nIn addition to data that the city maintains centrally, individual agencies maintain more-detailed data that they use for planning and management purposes. It was not practical in this project to obtain idiosyncratic data sets on a department-by-department basis. However, the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families, which has significant contracts with nonprofit organizations, provided detailed information on the funding allocations they make to nonprofit organizations. The appendix presents this information to illustrate the kind of supplemental information that may be available from individual departments.\n\n3.1 Identifying payments by department\nThe controller’s data are not always precise enough to identify departments with certainty.\nSeveral city entities are structured so that most of the services are performed or arranged by an administrative department or office, and the work is overseen by a commission that typically is responsible for setting policy and for community engagement, among other responsibilities.\nFor some of these commission-department arrangements, the controller’s data identifies whether a grant payment was made by the commission or the department. For example, the data include separate entries for the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families and for the Children & Families Commission (also known as First 5 San Francisco). In these cases, the tables below show separately the payments made by the commission and the department.\nFor other commission-department arrangements, the controller’s data do not specify which entity made the payment. This is the case for the Status of Women, the Police, Recreation and Parks, and the Environment. In these cases, the tables below label payments as being made by the relevant department, as departments typically have larger budgets and deliver or arrange most of the relevant services.\nFinally, several entities in the mayor’s office are responsible for service delivery, including the Office of Housing and Community Development, the Office on Disability, and the Office of Neighborhood Services. The controller’s data identifies payments made by the mayor’s office but does not attribute them to a specific sub-office. In the tables below, these payments are labeled as being made by the Office of Housing and Community Development because this is the largest group in the mayor’s office by far, and because the recipient entities appear to be delivering housing-related services.\n\n\n3.2 Nonprofit entities\nA nonprofit entity as the city defines it in these data must be a 501(c)(3) organization or similar entity, and must have a primary place of business that is a fixed office in San Francisco.\nThis report focuses on grants to nonprofit organizations, rather than all payments to nonprofits."
