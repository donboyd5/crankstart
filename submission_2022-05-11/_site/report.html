<ul>
<li><p>The City of San Francisco spent approximately $933 million on grants to nonprofit organizations in its 2020-21 fiscal year, according to data from the city controller.</p></li>
<li><p>The top five departments accounted for 89 percent of grants to nonprofits. Three of these departments accounted for more than $100 million each: Human Services ($347 million), Homelessness Services ($271 million), and Children, Youth and Their Families ($110 million).</p></li>
<li><p>Departments heavily involved in delivery of social services to children and the needy tend to spend a large share of their budget on payments to nonprofit organizations - generally 25 percent or more. Departments that focus on administrative services and more-technical matters typically spend 5 percent or less of their budget on payments to nonprofits. There is little middle ground.</p></li>
<li><p>The General Services Agency - City Administrator, which conducts centralized purchasing among other things contracted with more than 200 nonprofits, although the aggregate spending amount was relatively small. Departments involved in delivering services to children and the needy generally contracted with dozens, or even more than 100, nonprofit agencies.</p></li>
<li><p>More than 540 nonprofit organizations received city funds. The top five nonprofit entities receiving grant payments accounted for 30.8 percent of grants. The top three nonprofit recipients of city funds were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.childrenscouncil.org/">Children’s Council of San Francisco</a>, which focuses on supporting child care and early childhood education, received $85 million, or 9.1 percent of the total – the most of any nonprofit agency.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://www.sfihsspa.org/">San Francisco In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS) Public Authority</a>, a quasi-governmental public agency established by San Francisco ordinance that provides and promotes consumer-directed in-home support, received the next most, at $75 million (8.1 percent).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://ecs-sf.org/">Episcopal Community Services of San Francisco</a>, which provides support to homeless and very low-income people, received $48 million (5.2 percent).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Although many nonprofits receive funding from more than one city department, most receive the vast majority of their city funds from a single department.</p></li>
<li><p>The city controller’s data provides very little information on the uses of these funds. However, individual city departments maintain additional information on the purposes of specific grant funds. The Department of Children, Youth and Their Families provided data on their grant funded programs and are available in several forms, as discussed below.</p></li>

<p>Nonprofit organizations play an important role in delivering services and helping the needy in San Francisco. This report presents and analyzes information on the city’s payments to nonprofit organizations for the 2020-21 city fiscal year, ending June 30, 2021.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>The appendix provides tables on payments by all departments and nonprofit organizations, in a sortable format.

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-data"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> About the Data</h2>
<p>The analysis is based primarily on data maintained centrally by the city controller on payments to external organizations. Payments data provide information on actual spending in a specific time period, as opposed to budgeted (i.e., planned) spending, and as opposed to contract amounts, which may be spent over multiple years and may never be fully spent.</p>
<p>The city publishes its centrally maintained payments data through two main mechanisms. The <a href="https://openbook-report.sfgov.org/OBMiddleware/report.aspx">Open Book</a> portal allows creation of user-friendly reports filtered to restrict the data to specific time periods, departments, and other subsets; it allows downloads of potentially large amounts of data but is not designed primarily for that purpose. The <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/">Open Data</a> portal provides for bulk downloads of large data files and other information in computer-friendly formats. While the two publishing mechanisms draw on similar data, the data elements included and time periods covered may differ between Open Book and Open Data.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The city publishes data on payments to external organizations in the <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Vendor-Payments-Vouchers-/n9pm-xkyq">Vendor Payments file</a> on Open Data and makes similar user-friendly data available through a <a href="https://openbook-report.sfgov.org/OBMiddleware/report.aspx?reportname=5">Supplier Payments report</a> on Open Book. This latter file is the primary source of data used in this report.</p>
<p>In addition to data that the city maintains centrally, individual departments maintain more-detailed data that they use for planning and management purposes. These data differ in content and format from department to department, and may not exist in all departments. It was not practical in this project to obtain idiosyncratic data sets on a department-by-department basis.</p>
<p>However, the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families, which has significant contracts with nonprofit organizations, provided detailed information on the funding allocations they make to nonprofit organizations.</p>
<div>
<p>As noted above, the appendix presents these data from the DCYF departmental data system.</p>
</div>
<section id="identifying-payments-by-department" class="level3" data-number="3.1">
<h3 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identifying-payments-by-department"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Identifying payments by department</h3>
<p>The controller’s system of labeling payments is not always precise enough to identify with certainty the entity that made payments to nonprofits. This is especially true for departments that have associated commissions, and for the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>Several city activities are structured so that a <em>commission</em> sets policy, oversees operations, and takes the lead in community engagement, while most services are performed or arranged by a <em>department or office</em>. For example, the Recreation and Parks Department is overseen and governed by the Recreation and Parks Commission, which has seven members appointed by the mayor. Both the commission and the department may make payments to nonprofits, although typically payments by the latter are larger and more numerous.</p>
<p>For some of these commission-department arrangements, the controller’s data identifies whether a grant payment was made by the commission or the department. For example, the data include separate entries for the Department of Children, Youth and Their Families and for the Children &amp; Families Commission (also known as First 5 San Francisco). In this case, there is no uncertainty about which organization made a payment and the tables below show separate payments made by the commission and the department.</p>
<p>For other commission-department arrangements, the controller’s data do not specify which entity made the payment. This is the case for the Status of Women, the Police, Recreation and Parks, and the Environment. In these cases, the tables below <em>assume</em> payments were made by the department rather than the commission, as departments typically have larger budgets and deliver or arrange most of the relevant services.</p>
<p>A second area of uncertainty relates to the Mayor’s Office. The controller’s data lists payments by the Mayor’s Office but does not identify which sub-office or offices made or arranged those payments. Several entities in the Mayor’s Office appear to be responsible for arranging or delivering services, including primarily the Office of Housing and Community Development, and potentially the Office on Disability, and the Office of Neighborhood Services. Approximately 95 percent of the budget for the Mayor’s Office is listed under the heading of housing and community development ($197.0 million out of $206.3 million in 2020-21). Most of the nonprofit organizations receiving payments from the Mayor’s Office appear, judging by their names, to be related to housing and community development. The tables below do not attribute payments from the Mayor’s Office to individual sub-offices, but it is reasonable to assume that they are associated with the Office of Housing and Community Development.</p>

<p>The following table lists the city departments with the greatest payments to nonprofit organizations in 2020-21. It shows these payments as a percentage of all nonprofit payments citywide and as a percentage of each department’s budget.</p>
<p>Departments heavily involved in delivery of social services to children and the needy tend to spend a large share of their budget on payments to nonprofit organizations - generally 25 percent or more. Departments that focus on administrative services and more-technical matters typically spend 5 percent or less of their budget on payments to nonprofits. There is little middle ground (excepting, perhaps, the Human Rights Commission).</p>

<p>The table below shows payments by department and nonprofit organization, for the largest of each. (A separate table provides details on all departments and all nonprofit organizations.)</p>
<p>You had asked, in particular, about the $1.5 million payment from the Mayor’s Office to Tenderloin Housing Clinic, Inc., as part of a more-general question about why the Mayor’s Office is funding specific programs.</p>
<p>I briefly described the structure of the Mayor’s Office in the “About the Data” section. As to why the Office of Community and Housing Development (MOHCD) is in the Mayor’s Office rather than being a freestanding department, I don’t know. I didn’t find a written history of the department and I didn’t find a law establishing it. It is not a separately established office in <a href="https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/san_francisco/latest/sf_charter/0-0-0-163">Article IV of the city charter</a>. Nonetheless, references to the office are scattered throughout the charter and in separate ordinances, with no central section I could find that discusses its creation or responsibilities. One possibility is that some prior mayor decided that housing issues were so important that he or she wanted an agency that reported directly to the mayor, and did not want to go through the challenges of amending the city charter, and therefore established the office administratively. But that’s just one possibility.</p>
<p>As for the $1.5 million payment to Tenderloin Housing Clinic, Inc.&nbsp;(THC), you can see on the MOHD website that it works extensively with community partners, and lists THC as one of its <a href="https://sfmohcd.org/current-partners">partner Community Development Grantees</a>, along with several other organizations that appear in the table below. THC <a href="https://www.thclinic.org/about/mission.php">provides tenant protection services</a> and appears to fall into the core mission of MOHCD.</p>

Due to parent feedback, our after school workshops also include homework help.","The RAY Project connects youth with master-level artists in an effort to preserve the tradition of Capoeira, inspire learning, and build strong characters. Capoeira is a Brazilian art that combines self-defense, movement, and music in a rhythmic dialogue of body, mind, and spirit. Activities take place at ACSF's Capoeira Arts Center. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWorld-class artists provide instruction in Capoeira and related arts. Classes are complemented by student performances, guest artist workshops, and when possible, participation in events like SF Carnaval and ACSF’s Batizado-a traditional ceremony in which new students are welcomed into the tradition and continuing students graduate in level.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nClasses are divided by age (5-7; 8-12; 13-18) and offered afterschool and Saturdays.

Since 1986, we have worked to prevent summer learning loss, a primary contributor to California’s achievement and opportunity gaps. Each summer, we empower youth by providing them with an inclusive, supportive classroom experience that fosters a love of learning, develops academic mindsets and builds social and emotional skills. This helps ensure a successful transition to high school and college. Over the last 30+ years, we have prepared over 15,000 middle school students from low-income households for academic and career success. Our program operates in high-need areas spanning Oakland, San Francisco, East Palo Alto, Redwood City, Richmond, San Rafael, Novato, Napa, and the Tahoe-Truckee basin. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIn 2020, the pandemic forced us to move our program online. We reimagined academic and enrichment opportunities for a virtual world, and maintained the safe, inclusive and nurturing communities Aim High has always provided. Adolescents have a fundamental need to feel a genuine sense of belonging, and we successfully provided that this summer, even in a virtual format.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe don’t yet know what next summer will look like. Consequently, we are planning for one of three scenarios in 2021: (1) distance learning, (2) in-person but with a revised staffing/program model that meets public health guidelines, or (3) a hybrid version. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe are committed to providing our students with exceptional summer learning experiences, no matter the format. \r\r\r\n","The Alive &amp; Free Leadership Academy serves San Francisco middle and high school youth in grades 6-12 in need of additional academic support, and San Francisco TAY seeking High School Equivalency Credentials. The Alive &amp; Free Leadership Academy curriculum develops academic skill infused with the Alive &amp; Free prescription. Students learn to believe in themselves and deal with their anger, fear, and pain so they can realize and live their full potential. Trainings in the Alive &amp; Free Prescription violence prevention methodology ensure that educators, youth providers, counselors, police, and others understand violence is a preventable disease and how to use the method in their work with young people.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCOVID-19 has challenged us to change the way we deliver services to young people from in-person to virtual. We met this challenge to keep the Alive &amp; Free Leadership Academy classes going and collegians supported, quickly becoming adept at teaching interactively using the Zoom video platform. We increased support for collegians and high school students via telephone and text, ensuring they are ok and offering encouragement. We have established class guidelines for virtual participation. New students continue to enroll by completing our Student Information Form, which now is accessed via Google Doc. We collect attendance for each class. We send Zoom video class reminders to all students. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe role of Street Soldiers Radio has expanded. Alive &amp; Free students are staying connected to Alive &amp; Free and each other through Street Soldiers Radio, now broadcast using Zoom video and Facebook live. With COVID-19 and the trauma and protests around police violence, more than 5,000 people are tuning in to Street Soldiers each month, watching videos of shows, and downloading podcasts of the shows. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe initially had to put in Alive &amp; Free Prescription trainings on hold. We are now in the process of planning how to deliver trainings to smaller groups of six people on site and via Zoom video  while adhering to CDC guidelines for group activities.","America SCORES Bay Area inspires urban youth to lead healthy lives, be engaged students, and have the confidence and character to make a difference in the world.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOur Unique Approach - America SCORES partners with Bay Area schools and community centers to deliver team-based programs that integrate soccer, poetry, and service-learning.

DCYF supports ACTsmart Intensive Residencies at four SFUSD sites: Ida B. Wells High School (Theater Arts Class), Downtown High School (Acting for Critical Thought project), Hilltop Special Services Center (Theater Arts Class), and AccessSFUSD: The Arc. (Theater Arts Class) Students receive instruction in acting, playwriting, and other theater disciplines through highly customized curriculum that meets each partner's particular needs and students' cultural backgrounds and learning modalities, exploring the link between theater and issues most relevant to them. These residencies consist of 2-5 hours of weekly instruction for each student for 5-35 weeks, depending on the partner site's calendar and enrollment/credit schedule (quarter, semester, or full school year). Each residency culminates in a final performance, either in an A.C.T. venue or at the partner site, where students may participate in all aspects of theater production and share their work with fellow students, teachers, administration, family, and community members. Students also take field trips to attend A.C.T. performances and other cultural events, and scholarships are provided for interested students to participate in more advanced theater instruction in A.C.T.'s Young Conservatory theater training program.","26 family resource centers across the city operate under a shared vision built on families who are thriving, connected, and able to support their children's lifelong success.

Each day students come and do their homework, participate in enrichment activities, and have a warm nutritious meal and dynamic group discussions around a large family dinner table before getting driven back to their families. But most importantly, our students build lasting relationships with caring adults who guide and mentor them through the unique challenges these young students face in our community.","Our Home Away High School Program is a continuation of our School House Program for middle schoolers.  For our\r\r\r\nolder students more emphasis is given to professional development, greater personal responsibility, and\r\r\r\nnavigating the procedural challenges of applying to college or getting ready to enter the workforce. These\r\r\r\nstudents have an enormous need for both education and personal skill building as their families and\r\r\r\ncommunity role models often cannot serve that function. We will develop a vibrant College &amp; Career\r\r\r\nprogram, which, when added to our existing structure, will help our teens research and apply to the right\r\r\r\ncolleges and find the vocations best suited for them. We will then help them find scholarships to lighten the debt\r\r\r\nburden, and link them with mentors to provide guidance as they work to stay successful in school and\r\r\r\nsupport their college or workplace aspirations. We stay in close communication with the teens, including\r\r\r\npersonal check-ins, to make sure we’re addressing their emotional, psychological and logistical needs.\r\r\r\nIn summer, we help place our students in jobs and internships to develop responsibility and professional\r\r\r\nskills. We also expose them to on-site career and college education opportunities so they have a specific\r\r\r\nunderstanding of their options and can make specific plans for which colleges to target and/or what kinds of\r\r\r\napprenticeships to seek.","The A.P.

We meet five days a\r\r\r\nweek for six to eight hours per day over the span of six weeks at a designated SFUSD school site during June\r\r\r\nand July. Our elementary summer model structures the day into discrete classes focusing on literacy, math,\r\r\r\nscience, art, and physical recreation. Students are divided by grade level, and they remain in these groups for\r\r\r\nmost of the day. Each class is taught by a specialized instructor who creates curriculum specific for the grade\r\r\r\nlevel they are teaching. The daily summer schedule includes community circle time, structured physical\r\r\r\nactivities, lunch, and snack. We emphasize academic enrichment, skill building, and STEM programs and\r\r\r\nutilize SEL, cultural awareness, and youth development principles in all that we do. Students also attend\r\r\r\nweek-long afternoon clubs focusing on additional enrichments (e.g. dance, music, cooking, gymnastics, and\r\r\r\nservice learning). These programs are led by BACR multilingual Summer Program Leaders, sub-contractors\r\r\r\nand agency partners. The programs also include weekly field trips that utilize the many opportunities in the\r\r\r\nBay Area for enriching experiences (e.g. Zoos, Aquariums, and Art Museums). Integral to our programs are\r\r\r\nparent engagement activities such as open-house showcases, art exhibits, and student demonstrations of\r\r\r\nfinal projects.\r\r\r\n","The Bret Harte Elementary School and Community Hub Initiative Beacon Director (BD) will work closely with school leadership and community partners to coordinate community service (CS) programming and intentionally target services to address the prioritized needs of the school community.

We encourage students to complete a minimum of 25 hours of community service each year, 100 hours total throughout high school.  \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCollege Completion: College Completion programming supports students and families through the entire college experience: understanding admission requirements, virtually visiting campuses, selecting and applying to “best fit” colleges (schools with high success rates for low-income students), financial literacy education, applying to and obtaining scholarships and financial aid, and most importantly, enrolling in college and completing a four-year degree. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nTo ensure our students persist once they enroll in college, we pair each student with a college advisor that provides virtual and in-person support to help navigate the academic and/or social-emotional barriers that often interrupt college success for first generation and low-income students. Through one-on-one coaching, advisors encourage self-advocacy, empower students to access on-campus resources and build a community, continue crucial financial aid advising, and more. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBefore and after college graduation, College Track provides opportunities for high school and college graduates alike to network with one another and foster the College Track familial spirit across cohorts. We currently have an alumni network that expands the support we provide to alumni as more of our College Track students graduate with four-year degrees across our sites. By providing students with holistic resources and unique opportunities, our program enables students to identify their purpose and earn their way into the colleges and careers they deserve.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCOVID-19 Update: To continue the support while our partner schools and program site are closed or on modified in-person attendance, College Track has shifted to virtual programming through Zoom, Google Classroom and Instagram Live, including:  \r\r\r\n- One-on-one academic tutoring for all grade levels, including study skills coaching for adapting to the new learning environment\r\r\r\n- 1:1 Wellness support for students, staff and families with trained social workers\r\r\r\n- Regular community-building activities through Instagram Live\r\r\r\n- Virtual college tours and individual check-ins with seniors regarding college decisions, financial aid, and other concerns\r\r\r\n- College landscape, affordability, and application workshops via Zoom\r\r\r\n- One-on-one college affordability conferences with students and families","Community Works plans to provide rigorous and engaging social justice arts elective in the San Francisco Unified School District at The Academy – SF @ McAteer High School.

Despite the challenges of shelter-in-place orders and the COVID economy, we have been able to lean into a number of our strong community partnerships (SFUSD, City College of SF, Mission Bit, SFMade, SF Rec &amp; Parks), as well as long-term relationships corporate and nonprofit employment partners (UCSF, First Republic, City Hall, VendEx, Kaiser Permanente, Southern Exposure, SFMade, and more) to provide substantive workforce development programming for San Francisco youth in 2020. \r\r\r\nOur program model emphasizes building networks and communication skills through LinkedIn, career networking sessions with working professionals, and alumni events organized by the Enterprise Young Professionals Group.\t\t\t\t\r\r\r\nEach youth receives individualized support from their dedicated job coach, their workplace supervisor, and a network of trained volunteer mentors who support their professional development. Enterprise staff provide ongoing follow-up support and engagement activities after youth complete their job readiness training experience, ranging from career panels to financial literacy workshops to specialized opportunities with companies. We emphasize a multi-year program model to support youth throughout high school and into college; increasingly, youth are opting to participate in internships for two and three years following their first work experience. Youth also have the opportunity to join the Youth Council program, where participants further develop their leadership skills while building community through workshops covering event planning, marketing, design, personal and professional storytelling, and more.\r\r\r\nWe were proud to maintain our commitment to youth by providing paid workforce experience programs during the pandemic. We were able to offer placements to 204 youth this summer, including  our outdoor environmental stewardship internships through SF Rec &amp; Parks, virtual internships with 18 employment partners, joint ventures with City College (healthcare internship) and Mission Bit (technology internship), and newly designed internal Enterprise career exploration virtual internship.

In general every week, adult educators, teen staff, and children come together in a collaborative Tinkering workshop at two Clubhouses to 'learn by doing' with activities that engage learners with complex scientific principles through fun projects that can span single sessions or multiple. Program offerings have changed due to impacts of COVID-19, but continue to revolve around these dynamic, open-ended, material-based, collaborative experiences. While we accommodate social distancing protocols, our work has shifted to entirely virtual experiences through video and digital guides, online social platforms, and asynchronous making and prompt-sharing pivoted around flexible invitations for design, iteration, reflection, and shareout. Our offerings online also include an expanded audience of Boys &amp; Girls Clubhouses, allowing for more collaboration and discussion. This key youth development and education program gives students from marginalized backgrounds access to STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) learning in the context of creative, arts-based projects that encourage and support problem-solving, collaboration, and critical thinking. The program also employs and trains high-school-age facilitators who serve as near-peer mentors and co-designers of content and programming.","The Explainer program is an integrated work and learning experience for San Francisco high school students. Explainers began serving as museum docents in 1969, when the Exploratorium opened its doors to the public.

While historically our program has been focused around our museum visitor experience while providing youth both employment and development opportunities, this year we shifted our efforts to a primarily virtual experience.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIn June 2021, we have plans to transition back to in-person programming similar to our former programming if it is safe enough to do so. Prior to COVID-19, Explainers worked during museum hours, 6 days per week, and the museum provided flexible schedule options to work around high school schedules. Each teen received a minimum of 144 hours per session of academic enrichment, work-based learning, and pre-professional trainings.  We offered a 4-month summer session and an 8-month school term session.\r\r\r\n","The FACES SF extended care program enrolls children from 5-12 years old.

We provide them with the long-term support that their more well-off peers receive so that they can be competitive high school and college candidates. And, this long-term investment in their education and exposure to career options sets them on a path to build careers, not just jobs. Education is a right, not a privilege, and we work with students from the summer after sixth grade through college graduation (a 10 - 12 year journey) to help them attain their degrees and thereby help their families move out of poverty in a single generation.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThe goal of the First Career program for middle school students is to expose them to the breadth of career\r\r\r\npossibilities available with a college degree, and expand their thinking about opportunities in the future.

Additionally, we\r\r\r\naim to support these students during the afterschool hours. The Y program originated at Hillcrest Elementary in 2006 as a way to move the needle on literacy proficiency amongst low-income students.

Additionally, our program ensures that no one sits on the sidelines; we believe that all children regardless of background and/or disability can participate, learn and belong in our program. “While all students lose some ground in mathematics over the summer, low-income students lose more ground in reading, while their higher-income peers may even gain. Most disturbing is that summer learning loss is cumulative; over time, the difference between the summer learning rates of low-income and higher-income students contributes substantially to the achievement gap.” The goal of this program is to increase students’ academic success and boost self-confidence, while also engaging families in the education process. Students with disabilities, on average experience more significant skill loss than typical students during the summer months.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nFoundational to our work is to advance racial &amp; economic equity by cultivating diverse and inclusive environments for all.

Our plan is to work on our relationship/partnership in order to begin programming there for next summer.  Our plan for this initial year is the following:\r\r\r\n-To meet our number, to serve 230 youth. In the first 6 months our goal is to work on building Canon Barcus as well as working towards adding additional youth at Mission Housing locations. In addition we will also work with other low income housing units within the zip codes of our proposal to increase numbers.  Always working towards serving the target population of our proposal.\r\r\r\n-This past summer we served Mission Housing residents as well as Hillcrest school students who all met the target population (homeless or formerly homeless). We will continue to expand to prioritize this population as we have noticed a large increase in homeless youth in the zip codes listed in this proposal. \r\r\r\n-Over the course of this first year our numbers of 230 may not be met, however our intent is for quality and plan to continue on a daily basis while we build our programming to reach 233 by second year.\r\r\r\n","Mission YMCA serves the Dolores Huerta student community by cultivating diverse and inclusive environments where all program participants, families, volunteers, and staff can reach their fullest potential.

We have capacity for a total of 60 students.   We work with the principals and teachers at our local schools, primarily Starr King and Daniel Webster to receive recommendations on students who would benefit most from participating in our hub.  However, we have extended services and continue to fill open slots with students living on Potrero Hill, and attending various schools throughout the city.  We enroll students on a first come first served basis.  We have designed our program with on site and/or on line capabilities, to easily transition from one to the other, should the need arise.\r\r\r\nDuring the summer months our program runs from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, with extended services to support working parents.

We host quarterly events and an End of Summer Talent Show and Exhibition. We invite family and community members to share in these experiences on zoom.  \r\r\r\n","Youth often spend their days in a classroom and their evenings indoors, rarely venturing to neighborhood parks and open spaces. This lack of connection with the natural world leads to a sense of intimidation, a lack of knowledge about, and a perception of inaccessibility regarding the outdoors.  In 2007, we launched Earth Service Corps (ESC), a free program that empowers students to become global citizens by providing opportunities for leadership development, environmental education, and cross-cultural awareness.  We combine afterschool clubs and school-based activities with weekend service-learning projects important life skills and become life-long, stewards of the environment.","The Presidio YMCA is the lead agency for the Marina Middle School Beacon Community Center.

Each video will cover a new lesson on the brain-body connection. These lessons incorporate both conversational learning, animated photos or video clips, and movement activities. Participants will learn about the relationships between brain and body health and development, emotional processing, energy regulation, learning strategies, and wellness/mindfulness techniques. To increase learning integration, PC instructors will also schedule weekly 20-minute live virtual (Zoom) movement classes for participating classrooms that compliments the current cycle’s subject and is taught in the modality of dance, tumbling, capoeira, yoga, or creative movement. Virtual movement class curricula will incorporate exercises that support proprioceptive and vestibular development, challenge muscle strength and flexibility, and encourage confidence in trying new activities. These lessons and exercises aim to support students’ mental and physical health, agency over their own learning, creative expression, and empathy for both themselves and others as they navigate the challenges of an unpredictable school year with health concerns and added safety procedures.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDuring the early post-interim period, PC will meet with classroom teachers, social workers and administrators of our partnering elementary schools and their Beacon Centers (when applicable), to determine the current needs of students and their educational teams. Together, we will identify what strategies we will use to support students in weekly brain-body lessons and wellness activities through instructional videos and online classes. PC program coordinators will check in quarterly with school contacts to receive and give feedback in order to guide curricula as well as schedule or service delivery changes as the school year progresses. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPC Movement Classes: PC coaches will engage children in specialized 1-on-1 sessions and group movement classes, increasing their physical abilities, enhancing brain-body connection, improving self-regulation, developing empathy and building self-confidence. Our curriculum helps children/youth to internalize lifelong healthy habits. Over 45% of our in-studio participants have been diagnosed with special needs or learning/behavior challenges. With our one-on-one student coaching sessions, we are able to give students personalized attention and individualized activity options. Virtual group classes will meet 1x per week via Zoom, on weekday afternoons/evenings, and offer opportunity for peer social connections in parallel with physical learning. Students may enroll in 1 or more classes per week. Our semester-long sessions will have rolling enrollment so that families can join in at any point. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nPC will encourage youth, parents and caretakers who are enrolled in our in-studio classes to also utilize supplemental movement class videos on our YouTube channel. These videos are made to be complimentary educational additions to our movement classes, and offer detailed, age-appropriate explanations on the brain-body connection, wellness and self-regulation strategies.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nParent/Educator Support Workshops: PC will offer 2 workshops for early elementary educators, administrators and parents/caretakers. These neuroscience-informed interactive workshops are designed to introduce PC’s approach to movement classes and explain the importance of movement and play for student healthy development. One workshop will cover brain plasticity, neuronal connections, and movement/brain activation. Routine examples will cover activities for both in the classroom and the home environment. The second workshop will be targeted towards parents and caretakers, and will cover PC’s approach to movement classes and discuss the fundamentals of gross motor skill and sensory-vestibular development in young children. The goal of this workshop is to equip parents and caretakers with more ideas for how to incorporate movement activities into everyday life at home with the whole family. Both workshops will include wellness and self-care exercises aimed at supporting the health of these adults who care for children in our communities. Workshops will be promoted heavily to teachers and parents from our Schools on the Move partnering schools and organizations, and will also be open to the broader San Francisco community.\r\r\r\n","Project Level’s mission is to educate, inspire, and motivate the at-risk and underserved youth in our communities through the arts.

Through Reading Partners Traditional, our in-person program, we transform a dedicated space at each partner school into a fully-stocked reading center and recruit volunteer tutors to serve students who are reading below grade level proficiency. Through Reading Partners Connects, our distance tutoring platform, students and tutors will work together in a virtual space. In both iterations of our program, student-tutor pairs work together twice per week, following an individualized reading plan tailored to each student’s particular needs and strengths as well as Reading Partners’ goals for student reading achievement. Tutors use Reading Partners’ curriculum, a series of research-based, structured lessons plans that progress from phonics instruction for early readers to comprehension strategy instruction for more advanced students. In Reading Partners Connects, our evidence-based curriculum has been adapted into interactive presentations for the student and tutor to work through, accessing digital texts that are paired to each lesson. We assess students three times per year to monitor their progress toward pre-established grade-level achievement goals and to help advise tutors on how to best support their students. \r\r\r\nAt the time of writing, we know that SFUSD partner schools will not be providing in-school instruction until at least January. Because of the uncertainty around opening timelines, Reading Partners has decided to offer only Reading Partners Connects with students for the full school year. Reading Partners is also launching increased family engagement activities to help encourage and support reading at home outside of school. Given that caregivers will likely be supporting their student's learning remotely, we are designing resources, learning packets, and engagement opportunities for families to support with their student's literacy development.","R.O.C.K. provides year-round programs to keep children engaged and facilitate continuous learning.

In recent years, SFCASA has undergone a significant period of growth and positive change that will further enhance our ability to serve our foster youth clients. We are mid-way through a four-year growth plan to expand our reach to 400 youth annually by 2020, while deepening our impact on the youth we serve. We have exceeded our goal of youth served for the past two years and have implemented a new outcomes measurement and learning system which will significantly increase our understanding of program impact and inform how to best serve our youth clients.  \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSFCASA will accomplish the purpose of the grant through our Core Advocacy and Mentorship Program, which empowers members of the community to become officers of the court to serve as advocates and mentors to children in foster care or in the juvenile justice system. Volunteers (CASAs) are closely supervised by professional case supervisors who match our young clients to a volunteer once they have completed the 42-hour training and have been officially appointed by the court. CASAs gather information to assess their assigned youth’s situation, needs, and opportunities: visiting their placement, reviewing documents and records, speaking with the youth’s caregiver and professionals, and meeting regularly with the youth to get to know them and build a trusting relationship. Through a collaborative effort, CASAs develop strengths-based plans to move the child forward.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nEvery six months, CASAs file a formal court report and attend a court hearing with their assigned youth, advocating for services in the child’s best interests, including medical and dental appointments, psychological evaluations, therapy, special education evaluations, tutoring, family finding, sibling/family visits, and housing changes. CASAs matched with youth 14 or older also focus mentoring efforts and develop self-advocacy skills in preparation for the client’s emancipation from the foster care system, including housing, postsecondary education, financial literacy skills, and employment. Recommendations by a CASA are made directly to the presiding judge and are generally approved by the court because of the CASA’s comprehensive knowledge of the child. As one volunteer described it, CASAs are “the glue that connects the pieces in a complicated child welfare system.” \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIn their role, CASAs go beyond advocating for basic needs. They help youth identify and explore strengths and interests and work to ensure their youth is able to participate in normal childhood activities that develop resilience and are important to social and emotional development, such as summer camps, sports teams, music lessons or academic programs. SFCASA has relationships with hundreds of local programs to facilitate our clients’ participation. CASAs also work to build a personal relationship and provide a consistent adult presence for youth, a core tenet of the CASA model that helps youth build trust and emotional attachment and is an important aspect of healthy development.\r\r\r\n","Our Education and Job-Readiness program will provide disconnected, out-of-school San Francisco youth (over\r\r\r\nage 18) with comprehensive program services including educational advancement, work-based learning\r\r\r\nopportunities, job readiness training, career exploration, and transition support services.

Driven by their passions, students engage in experiential learning and community service to explore a variety of different fields (e.g. the arts, STEM, activism, creative writing, leadership, entrepreneurship, and more), creating networks and developing interests that propel them through college and beyond. We encourage students to complete a minimum of 25 hours of community service each year, 100 hours total throughout high school.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCollege Completion: College Completion programming supports students and families through the entire college experience: understanding admission requirements, virtually visiting campuses, selecting and applying to “best fit” colleges (schools with high success rates for low-income students), financial literacy education, applying to and obtaining scholarships and financial aid, and most importantly, enrolling in college and completing a four-year degree.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nTo ensure our students persist once they enroll in college, we pair each student with a college advisor that provides virtual and in-person support to help navigate the academic and/or social-emotional barriers that often interrupt college success for first generation and low-income students. Through one-on-one coaching, advisors encourage self-advocacy, empower students to access on-campus resources and build a community, continue crucial financial aid advising, and more.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBefore and after college graduation, College Track provides opportunities for high school and college graduates alike to network with one another and foster the College Track familial spirit across cohorts. We currently have an alumni network that expands the support we provide to alumni as more of our College Track students graduate with four-year degrees across our sites. By providing students with holistic resources and unique opportunities, our program enables students to identify their purpose and earn their way into the colleges and careers they deserve.","Community Works plans to provide rigorous and engaging social justice arts elective in the San Francisco Unified School District at The Academy – SF @ McAteer High School.

In addition to the regular teaching staff, we invite experts from the community to be guest speakers at the program. This deepens the work and brings current authentic voices and experiences into the room.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThrough daily instruction over four weeks, the participants will learn Flyaway’s choreography and be mentored by Flyaway's teaching artists to brainstorm, design, execute, critique, and complete their own site-specific dances in the Gardens. The girls will learn best practices for Art and Activism; and they’ll gain self-efficacy and management skills -personal accountability, integrity, punctuality, teamwork, and respectful communication. GIRLFLY serves to deepen each students' artistic experience, ownership in that experience, and mentoring and community engagement opportunities within the program.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nGIRLFLY IN THE GARDENS 2021 will conclude with two site-specific, outdoor performances for the community (but limited by Covid), and a digital print of the participant's writing.

The GOTRBA program is designed to help offset the insufficient physical education activities available in the neighborhoods served by the targeted schools. Many of the neighborhoods served by us lack quality, affordable after-school programs and activities for elementary school age students, especially for girls. Our program helps close that gap in critical physical and healthy lifestyle education for young girls. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCoaches train and lead non-competitive activities around topics that promote physical and emotional health. The girls collaborate to complete a Community Impact Project that supports the community of their choice. Each girl receives a Girls on the Run t-shirt and water bottle. Every girl whose family cannot afford running shoes receives a new pair purchased by GOTRBA. At the end of the season, the program culminates with the Girls on the Run 5K event. Completing the 5K gives girls a real understanding of the confidence gained through this accomplishment and a framework for setting and achieving life goals.","GirlVentures’ summer and afterschool programs provide girls with the opportunity to form healthy relationships and learn teamwork, while backpacking, camping, kayaking, and rock climbing. Developing these skills enables them to break down barriers to what they believed they could accomplish, as they gain access to nontraditional, historically male-dominated activities. They then learn how to apply these character-building experiences to their broader lives. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOur spring and summer courses build on the strengths girls find within themselves, as well as the skills they have learned in other GirlVentures programs. On 5 to 14-day summer expeditions throughout the Northern California wilderness, our instructors lead activities and discussions from our innovative curriculum centered on social-emotional development, concluding with graduation ceremonies where participants’ achievements are celebrated as they are reunited with their families. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nTo empower girls throughout the school year we provide an after-school rock climbing mentored program, Girls Climb On, in San Francisco and Oakland. Girls aged 11 – 15 are paired with volunteer mentors who promote confidence and collaboration, while teaching or building on their climbing skills on both indoor and outdoor rock walls. Each week, our curriculum focuses on issues that connect climbing with girls’ emotional strengths, promoting confidence and collaboration. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOur Youth Advisory Board allows high school girls who have completed a GirlVentures course to build on these experiences throughout the school year, strengthen their leadership and professional skills, learn from mentors and each other, connect with community service opportunities, and gain insight into serving on a board. YAB participants meet once a month as a group with their mentors, meet separately with mentors during the month, and engage in individual personal development activities that culminate with an end-of-year presentation. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nBy providing course-specific gear, healthy food, and transportation to all participants, and need-based financial aid to two-thirds of girls, we make transformative experiences in the outdoors possible. Additionally, our courses are offered at a significant discount to all participants. To ensure girls have access to our transformative courses regardless of their background, two-thirds of participants receive need-based sliding scale scholarships.","Glide’s Afterschool and Summer Program (ASP) is located at the Janice Mirikitani Family, Youth, and Childcare Center (FYCC).

We want to increase the socio-economic diversity in our student population by providing access to more low- income and POC identifying students. We were able to leverage the partnerships we built through our participation in the CLH Initiative to identify students who could participate in this new program. The art-base afterschool enrichment program engaged students from neighborhood schools: Cobb-, Rosa Parks-, Claire Lilienthal Elementary Schools (all SFUSD schools we served pre pandemic), the Children’s Council, and the Tenderloin Day School, as well as the families who attended our CLH at the JCCSF. Due to internal and external factors, including critical illness of two out of three enrichment instructors, the JCCSF made the difficult decision to sunset the program in October 2021. JCCSF leadership assisted all families in finding new Afterschool enrichment – for example at the YMCA and Richmond Neighborhood Center. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nOCTOBER – DECEMBER 2021: \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWith the JCCSF’s new Chief of Program, Family Life fully onboarded and in close collaboration with community partners at SFUSD, the JCCSF is planning to expand art-based enrichment at four Mission neighborhood schools, including Visual Arts, Music and Theater Arts instruction for K-5 graders starting in January 2022. In addition, this grant will support the planning and implementation of JCCSF art-based enrichment camps in June 2022. The team will continue to engage Afterschool teacher Melissa Willet’s expertise in designing and facilitating STEAM camps. She earned her M.A. in Art Education, along with a Pre-K to 12 Teacher’s Art Certification, participated in the Gallery of African Art Residency Program and has worked as an arts educator with POC students in low-income neighborhoods around San Francisco. It is only with the support of this grant that the JCCSF Family Life team can scale its impact in the city of San Francisco, offering free, high-quality arts enrichment to more children than ever before. For that, we are grateful. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nJANUARY – JUNE 2022:  \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nProgram activity directly serving children and their families supported by this grant include:  \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- 16 instructional hours per week in four Mission-based SFUSD schools per instructor (2), including Visual Arts, Music and Theater Arts, serving at least 270 K-5 students. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- A final showcase / exhibition of student work at the JCCSF 3200 California Street building \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\n- Three JCCSF art-based camp weeks (9:00 am - 4:00 pm / 5 days per week), serving an estimated 140 K-8 kids in the month of June 2022.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nFUTURE GOALS: The JCCSF’s long-term goal for this program is scale back to pre-pandemic participation and beyond by to bringing its signature Afterschool program onsite to more SFUSD schools or to other neighborhood locations. Introducing a final showcase component at the JCCSF building will open doors for children and their families to make use of the full scope of family services and creative programs available at the JCCSF. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThese changes will allow us to provide a more conveniently located program to families, impact as many communities and families as possible and align with our mission to cultivate connections for a more vibrant community through discovery, well-being and purpose.","Launched in 2014, the Jewish Community Center of San Francisco’s (JCCSF) Citywide program enhances the physical and socioemotional development of disadvantaged K-5 youth in the Mission District.

Because the majority of Juma youth are unaware of the opportunities available to them, YouthConnect exposes young people to careers in local high-growth industries by taking them on workplace and education tours, and hosting panels featuring individuals from diverse professions such as advanced manufacturing, healthcare, retail, hospitality, logistics and technology. In addition, youth participate in job search skills workshops such as resume writing and mock interviewing. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nLeveraging the teachable moment of a first paycheck, Juma’s financial capability services provide youth the opportunity to develop lifelong money management skills. Under the guidance of Juma’s Program Coordinators, youth open bank accounts and participate in financial education workshops on topics such as money management, budgeting, saving, financial products, credit and debt, and fraud. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nCONNECT: To connect youth to their next job and long term sustained employment, Juma partners with corporations primarily in the retail, hospitality, and logistics industries. Juma currently has 13 national anchor partners such as Gap Inc., CVS Health, Starbucks and UPS who demonstrate a commitment to impact hiring and to developing young employees beyond the entry level. Once a young adult is hired, Juma’s Program Coordinators offer 90 days retention support that takes the form of continued soft skills coaching, help understanding the corporation’s career mobility pathways and strengthen communication with supervisors. By ensuring that youth understand the job expectations, manage any budding conflicts, and receive proper training, Juma is able to increase the chances that youth understand how to access and maximize their employer’s training and advancement opportunities.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Juma has virtualized all programming and will continue to deliver workshops via Zoom in the 2021-2022 calendar year.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nThrough Juma’s adapted programming sequence now delivered via Zoom, a Program Coordinator supports each youth, helping them get 'job ready', master 21st Century soft skills, develop lifelong money management skills, explore education/career pathways, etc. To enhance virtual learning, Juma uses a \"Youth Self Assessment\" that allows each young person to assess themselves in different programmatic areas (past job experience, financial capabilities, etc.). This tool allows youth to set and attain short- and long-term personal, financial, educational and career goals using. Additionally, youth are assisted with opening bank accounts, participate in financial education workshops, and weekly $25 incentives. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nLastly, with the loosening of COVID-19 restrictions and the start of the baseball season, we have safely started opening part of our local social enterprises at Oracle Park and begin offering youth hands on job training.

Outward Bound California (OBCA) will provide youth leadership programs at OBCA's McLaren Park Challenge Course built in partnership with the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department. We completed construction in September 2020, passed all city and health inspections and had our program plan approved to operate November 2020.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWe serve groups of 16  participants at a time, 3 times a week during school hours. These Insight Days will serve underrepresented students from (1) SFUSD high and middle schools, (2) partner nonprofits, and (3) neighborhoods including  Visitacion Valley, Sunnydale, Excelsior, Ingleside, Bayview, Portola and the Mission. Students and educators embark on one-time and sequential 1-day outdoor challenges designed to cultivate teamwork, social awareness, communication, trust, leadership skills, and character.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nDuring each program, students participate in an orientation including icebreakers, goal setting, group learning agreements, and a review of the day's activity. They then move through 4 to 6 low elements on the ropes course, working together toward common goals, communication and problem solving.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nAfter lunch, students progress to high elements on the ropes course, moving across cables or beams 30-40 feet high while belayed and encouraged by classmates on the ground. The culmination is a 'leap of faith' in which students leap out and catch a bar representing a challenge or goal in their lives. The high elements help students develop compassion and a deeper understanding of opportunities for growth, all the while safely secured by our facilitation staff.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nEach day will end with a group circle to debrief and reflect, celebrate success, and share ways students can apply lessons at home or school. Safety and program impact are our top priorities and a program like a ropes course takes a lot of training and support to run effectively. This is why the course won't be open to unstructured public use but we will host Community Days for the public once a month free of charge where residents of SF and surrounding communities can sign up and experience the course. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nWith COVID restrictions potentially easing and schools returning to in person, we plan to build towards sequential programming in 2022.

Through Reading Partners Connects, our distance tutoring platform, students and tutors will work together in a virtual space. In both iterations of our program, student-tutor pairs work together twice per week, following an individualized reading plan tailored to each student’s particular needs and strengths as well as Reading Partners’ goals for student reading achievement. Tutors use Reading Partners’ curriculum, a series of research-based, structured lesson plans that progress from phonics instruction for early readers to comprehension strategy instruction for more advanced students. In Reading Partners Connects, our evidence-based curriculum has been adapted into interactive presentations for the student and tutor to work through, accessing digital texts that are paired to each lesson. We assess students three times per year to monitor their progress toward pre-established grade-level achievement goals and to help advise tutors on how to best support their students. \r\r\r\nAt the time of writing, our SFUSD partner schools have reported plans to return to full-time, in-person instruction for all students from the start of the year. They have also reported that it is likely that our Reading Partners staff and AmeriCorps members will be allowed to return to serve on campus full-time. However, they are not clear the extent to which additional adults, including our community-based volunteers, will be allowed on campus regularly. We are therefore preparing to connect students to their tutoring sessions on-campus through Reading Partners Traditional (if tutors can be on-campus), Reading Partners Connects (if tutors cannot be on campus), or a hybrid of both. After a successful pilot during COVID restrictions, Reading Partners is also continuing increased family engagement activities to help encourage and support reading at home outside of school.

In recent years, SFCASA has undergone a significant period of growth and positive change that will further enhance our ability to serve our foster youth clients. We recently completed a four-year growth plan to expand our reach to serve more youth annually, while deepening our impact on the youth we serve. We implemented a new outcomes measurement and learning system which will significantly increase our understanding of program impact and inform how to best serve our youth clients. And we are excited as we look ahead to FY21-22 when we will complete a new strategic plan to guide our work for the years to come. \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSFCASA will accomplish the purpose of the grant through our Core Advocacy and Mentorship Program, which empowers members of the community to become officers of the court to serve as advocates and mentors to children in foster care or in the juvenile justice system. Volunteers (CASAs) are closely supervised by professional case supervisors who match our young clients to a volunteer once they have completed the 42-hour training and have been officially appointed by the court. CASAs gather information to assess their assigned youth’s situation, needs, and opportunities: visiting their placement, reviewing documents and records, speaking with the youth’s caregiver and professionals, and meeting regularly with the youth to get to know them and build a trusting relationship. Through a collaborative effort, CASAs develop strengths-based plans to move the child forward.\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nEvery six months, CASAs file a formal court report and attend a court hearing with their assigned youth, advocating for services in the child’s best interests, including medical and dental appointments, psychological evaluations, therapy, special education evaluations, tutoring, family finding, sibling/family visits, and housing changes. CASAs matched with youth 14 or older also focus mentoring efforts and develop self-advocacy skills in preparation for the client’s emancipation from the foster care system, including housing, postsecondary education, financial literacy skills, and employment. Recommendations by a CASA are made directly to the presiding judge and are generally approved by the court because of the CASA’s comprehensive knowledge of the child. As one volunteer described it, CASAs are “the glue that connects the pieces in a complicated child welfare system.”\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nIn their role, CASAs go beyond advocating for basic needs. They help youth identify and explore strengths and interests and work to ensure their youth is able to participate in normal childhood activities that develop resilience and are important to social and emotional development, such as summer camps, sports teams, music lessons or academic programs. SFCASA has relationships with hundreds of local programs to facilitate our clients’ participation.

Although we typically partner with schools/organizations serving a large percentage of children residing in low-income households (e.g., schools/districts that receive Title I funding), school/organization leaders are ultimately responsible for identifying the children who would most benefit from our services. Our curriculum will be implemented in varying dosages at multiple sites and times during the day/week. 2021-2022 seasonal program windows will likely span the following dates: summer 2021 (6/7/2021 to 8/13/2021); fall 2021 (7/12/2021 to 9/10/2021); and winter/spring 2022 (11/8/2021 to 6/3/2022). \r\r\r\n\r\r\r\nSpringboard accelerates reading growth through a combination of personalized instruction for elementary students, workshops training parents to teach reading at home, professional development opportunities for teachers, and leadership opportunities for program leaders. We support schools and districts in various ways, but all of our programs leverage the same underlying methodology: Springboard’s Family-Educator Learning Accelerator (FELA). FELAs are five to ten-week cycles during which teachers and parents team up to help kids achieve reading goals. In the beginning, stakeholders--students, teachers, and family members--establish a solid foundation through a team-building huddle where they set goals and establish a shared game plan. Over the course of the FELA cycle, they come together at five family workshops to share skills and strategies. On a daily basis, children work toward their goals by practicing with their teachers, with their families, and on their own. The cycle concludes by measuring progress and celebrating together with a capstone celebration and incentives.\r\r\r\n","The Miraloma After School Program strives to create a safe and caring environment where our students can thrive through our academic, enrichment, and recreation activities.

<p>You asked about payments by the Homelessness Department over time. Because the focus of this project was on a single recent year, I have not investigated the data for anomalies and I suggest using the following table with caution. However, it is an accurate summary of the city controller’s data for city fiscal year 2017-18 (labeled as 2018) through city fiscal year 2020-21 and does show the significant growth in spending by this department.</p>
